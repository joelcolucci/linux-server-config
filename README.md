*Not available at time of completion of project

###Project Overview
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

###Project Tasks
#####Task: Launch your Virtual Machine with your Udacity account
######Status: Complete

#####Task: Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server
######Status: Complete

#####Task: Create a new user named grader
######Status: Complete
```
sudo adduser grader
```

#####Task: Give the grader the permission to sudo
######Status: Complete
```
visudo
```
Find root user line that looks as follows:
```
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
Add new user by entering the following line:
```
grader ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

#####Task: Update all currently installed packages
######Status: Complete
```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

#####Task: Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200
######Status: Complete
Create backup of sshd_config file:
```
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults
```
Open sshd_config file, comment out "Port 22" and add "Port 2200".
Snippet of sshd_config file:
```
# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
# Port 22
Port 2200
```

#####Task: Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)
######Status: Complete
```
ufw enable

# Ensure we do not lock ourselves out!
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow 2200 # Handle changed ssh port
ufw allow http
ufw allow ntp
```

#####Task: Configure the local timezone to UTC
######Status: Complete
I set the local timezone to UTC by configuring the tzdata package.
```
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```
I then selected "None of the above" and finally "UTC".

#####Task: Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application
######Status: Complete
```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

apt-get install apache2

apt-get install python-setuptools libapache2-mod-wsgi

service apache2 restart
```

#####Task: Install and configure PostgreSQL:
######Status: Complete
```
apt-get install postgresql
```
Login to postgres with :
```
sudo -i -u postgres
```

#####Task: Within postgres do not allow remote connections
######Status: Complete
Verified that no remote connections are allowed by inspecting the pg_hba.conf file.

This file can be viewed with the following command
```
less /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
```

#####Task: Within postgres create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database
######Status: Complete
```
sudo su - postgres
psql
```
```
CREAT ROLE catalog LOGIN;
```

#####Task: Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!
######Status: Incomplete
Install git:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install git
```
